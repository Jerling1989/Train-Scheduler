# Train-Scheduler
Here is an app designed to keep someone from missing the train. Any user can put in information about a Train Schedule and the app will keep track of the Train's progress. I designed it with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and Firebase, with a little bit of tongue-in-cheek style choices.
